## üåç Why PyEyesWeb?

PyEyesWeb builds on the **Expressive Gesture Analysis** methods of EyesWeb, 
bringing qualitative movement analysis into **Python** as a core aim of the project,
creating a modern, modular, and accessible toolkit for research, health, and artistic applications.  

PyEyesWeb is designed to facilitate adoption in **artificial intelligence and machine learning pipelines**,
while also enabling seamless integration with **creative and interactive platforms**
such as **TouchDesigner, Unity, Unreal Engine, and Max/MSP**, supporting innovative,
cross-disciplinary projects at the intersection of science and the arts.

<a href="https://casapaganini.unige.it/eyesweb_bp" target="_blank">EyesWeb</a> is an open software research platform for the design and development of <b>real-time multimodal systems and interfaces</b>.  
It supports a wide variety of inputs, including motion capture, cameras, game controllers (Kinect, Wii), multichannel audio, and physiological signals.  
<br><br>
Outputs include multichannel audio, video, analog devices, and robotic platforms. EyesWeb provides libraries such as <b>Non-Verbal Expressive Gesture Analysis</b> and <b>Non-Verbal Social Signals Analysis</b>, and a visual programming environment that enables users to develop <b>real-time, networked applications</b>.  
<br><br>
Originally started in 1997, EyesWeb has been adopted worldwide in scientific research, education, and industry, including EU projects and collaborations with organizations such as INTEL and NYU.
